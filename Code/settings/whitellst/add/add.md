<h1>Settings Whitelist Add Subalias<img align="right" src="../../../../Data/main.png" width="100px"></h1>

Subalias that allows staff members to add channels to the whitelisted channel IDs

## Help:
`tame settings whitelist add [channel id]`

If you do not know how to get the channel ID of a channel, use this [link](https://tokenizedhq.com/discord-channel-id/#how-to-get-a-discord-channel-id). As of 3/1/24, this should help teach how to enable developer mode and then how to collect channel IDs.

If whitelist is empty, all channels/threads are allowed.
