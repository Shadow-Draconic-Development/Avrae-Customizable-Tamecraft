<h1>Settings Creatures Rename Subalias<img align="right" src="../../../../Data/main.png" width="100px"></h1>

Subalias that allows staff members to rename creatures in the tamable list

## Help:
`tame settings creatures rename [old creature name] [new creature name]`

Any current tamings in process that use the creature removed will have their name updated via a mapping table. Try not to rename creatures too often as it will limit SVAR storage capacity and slow down the taming alias.
