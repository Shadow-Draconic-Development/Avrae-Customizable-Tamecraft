<h1>Customizable Tamecraft<img align="right" src="Data/main.png" width="100px"></h1>

Customizable Tame craft allows players to tame creatures over and over without staff supervision. The creatures you can tame are only limited by what staff members put. This content library is not dependant upon monster content, allowing staff members to readily add homebrew creatures. This does utilize the [XP](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/618b77bd5c51fd18fe5356a0) content library, however, it is not required. You just have to access XP and the XP log in CVARs `xp` and `xplog` respectively.

This content library leverages the use of subaliases to allow staff members of varying Avrae experience to alter settings within `tame_settings` SVAR. Here are the following settings they can alter:
- [creatures](https://github.com/Shadow-Draconic-Development/Avrae-Customizable-Tamecraft/blob/main/Code/settings/creatures/creatures.md)
    - add
    - edit
